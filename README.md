# OpenShift Base Setup

This repository contains basic OpenShift setup files which I apply to our OpenShift cluster after installation.
These files are monitored by ArgoCD to ensure the cluster configuration is always in line with this repository. Any live changes to the cluster will be overwritten 
by ArgoCD.
